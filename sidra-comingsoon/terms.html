                    to provide you with our
                    Services (e.g., logistics businesses used to deliver products to you, marketing companies, payments
                    processors to process online transactions, etc.). other businesses may be involved in your
                    transactions, and they may store your Information in a digital wallet to help you utilises our

                    to relevant data in order to
                    fulfil their tasks. We'll make sure that these companies don't use your information for anything
                    else. We may also obtain information from these businesses (for example, updated delivery and
                    address information), which we may utilise (e.g., to correct our records and deliver your next
                    purchase). By using our Platform, you expressly consent to the transfer, storage, use, and
                    disclosure of your data among our affiliates and/or non-affiliated service providers, regardless of
                    their location. These businesses will be contractually obligated to keep your information private.

                    advertisers to assist them in reaching the type of audience they desire while also allowing us to
                    meet our obligations to our advertising (e.g., by displaying their advertisements to a target
                    audience).</p>
